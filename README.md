# R-intro
This R-presentation is designed to give experimentalists an overview of the general workflow of R as used by statisticians.
Through this we try to bring experimentalists (i.e. biologists in our case)  and statisticians closer together.
Hence our goal is to facilitate collaborations between the two groups.
