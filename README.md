# R-intro
This R-presentation is designed to give experimentalists an overview of the general workflow of R.
Through this we try to bring experimentalists (i.e. biologists in our case) and statisticians closer together.
Our goal is to facilitate collaborations between the two groups by giving advice on data exchange formats and practices.
