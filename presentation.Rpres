Topics
========================================================

1. **What is R?** - How does it work? How does it store these numbers?
2. **From Excel to R** - What are the pitfalls?
3. **Fitness of tables** - How to prepare R-compatible tables?
4. **Best practices** - How to keep frustration levels minimal?
5. **Library** - Collection of helpful sources to seriously start learning R.


Disclaimer
========================================================

We do **not** want you to become R experts from a 2h lecture.

We **do** want to ease collaborations by giving you a basic understanding of what is happening *behind the scenes*.

We will focus on **what** R can do rather than why it can do that.


What is R? (1)
========================================================
R is a programming language, thus you can compute things:
```{r}
  1+2+3+4
  ((1+1*5)^2+6)/7
  sum(1:10)
```


What is R? (2)
========================================================
You can store values into variables and use them for calculations:
```{r}
  number_of_people_in_this_room <- 17
  
  # You can write comments to explain your code
  # (they are ignored, but help understanding)
  
  # Check if number is even (divisible by two)
  # 0=Yes 1=No
  number_of_people_in_this_room %% 2
```


What is R? (3)
========================================================
More than one value can go into a single variable as well:
```{r}
  speaker_names <- c("Katinka", "Simon")
  # They are stored in a numbered list
  # Access single items with square brackets
  speaker_names[2]
  # R calls these lists of items: vector
  speaker_names
```


What is R? (4)
========================================================
Ranges of numbers are designed for easy use:
```{r}
numbers_from_1_to_10 <- 1:10
numbers_from_1_to_10
#remember the example from the first slide?
sum(numbers_from_1_to_10)
```


What is R? (5)
========================================================
Data frames, the most important data structure:
```{r}
  # a data frame is a table with labeled rows
  # and columns
  speakers <- data.frame(
    row.names=speaker_names,
    species=c("human", "human"),
    hair_color=c("blonde","brown")
    )
  #print data frame
  speakers
```


What is R? (6)
========================================================
Data frames, the most important data structure:
```{r}
  # access a column by name
  speakers$hair_color
  # or by index [row,col] where empty means all
  # so give me column 1 of all rows
  speakers[,1]
```


What is R? (7)
========================================================
How to select rows by name?
```{r}
  # if row name equals
  simon_row <- row.names(speakers) == "Simon"
  # returns a vector of True and False values
  simon_row
  
  # This can be used as index list as well
  # with row index simon_row return all columns
  speakers[simon_row,]
```


From Excel to R? (1)
========================================================
Excel tables and data frames are similar, however:
- Data frames must not have different column lengths
- Row and column names are not part of the cells
- Spaces in names are not allowed ($-syntax would not work)
- Column names must be unique
- Non-rectangular tables are problematic
- **One row represents one dataset**

How does this apply to reality?


From Excel to R? (2)
========================================================

***

Example Excel sheet with:
- unique headers
- no spaces
- rectangular


From Excel to R? (3)
========================================================
In R this looks like:
```{r}
  pen_experiment <- read.csv("data/pens.csv")
  pen_experiment
```


From Excel to R? (4)
========================================================
That did not look correct:
```{r}
  pen_experiment <- read.csv("data/pens.csv",
                             header=TRUE,
                             row.names=1,
                             sep=";")
  pen_experiment
```


From Excel to R? (5)
========================================================
Useful next steps:
```{r}
  summary(pen_experiment)
```


From Excel to R? (6)
========================================================
Putting comments at the top of your Excel file makes life easier:
![A table of pen sizes and colors in Excel](presentation-figure/excel2.png)
***
```{r, eval=FALSE}
  read.csv("data/pens2.csv",
        header=TRUE,
        row.names = 1,
        sep=";",
        comment.char = "#")
```


Fitness of Tables? (1)
========================================================
Unfortunately reality often looks different
![A table of photometric measurements as seen in the wild](presentation-figure/excel3.png)


Fitness of Tables? (2)
========================================================
```{r}
  read.csv("data/nightmare.csv",header=TRUE,
                sep=";",dec=",",comment.char = "#")
```


Fitness of Tables? (3)
========================================================
Problems with this layout
![A table of photometric measurements as seen in the wild](presentation-figure/excel3.png)
---
- These are four tables not one
- Tables are placed almost randomly 
- row and column identities are inconsistent
- One row = One dataset violated


Fitness of Tables? (4)
========================================================
New Layout:
![A table of photometric measurements redesigned for R-compatibility](presentation-figure/excel4.png)
***

- Now we have one table
- Distinction between four tables is implemented through extra category (column)
- One row = One dataset 


Fitness of Tables? (5)
========================================================
This looks better in R:
```{r} 
  better<-read.csv("data/bettersleep.csv",header=TRUE,
                sep=";", dec=",",comment.char = "#")
  better 
```


Fitness of Tables? (6)
========================================================
Now we can start processing the data:
```{r}
  table(better$treatment)
  summary(better$nadh_conc)
```


Best Practices. (1)
========================================================
The mission:
  - mark important genes

Best Practices (2)
========================================================
DONT

filtering only by color is undetectable in csv

Best Practices (4)

BEST

Best Practices (5)
========================================================
It is not always about R:
* opportunity to improve Excel skills as well
  - and save time
* compatibility to many tools instead of just one
* closer to the file formats produced by lab hardware
