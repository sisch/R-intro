Topics
========================================================

1. **What is R?** - How does it work? How does it store these numbers?
2. **From Excel to R** - What are the pitfalls?

5. **Library** - Collection of helpful sources to seriously start learning R.


Disclaimer
========================================================

We do **not** want you to become R experts from a 2h lecture.

We **do** want to ease collaborations by giving you a basic understanding of what is happening *behind the scenes*.

We will focus on **what** R can do rather than why it can do that.


What is R? (1)
========================================================
R is a programming language, thus you can compute things:

```r
  1+2+3+4
```

```
[1] 10
```

```r
  ((1+1*5)^2+6)/7
```

```
[1] 6
```

```r
  sum(1:10)
```

```
[1] 55
```


What is R? (2)
========================================================
You can store values into variables and use them for calculations:

```r
  number_of_people_in_this_room <- 17
  
  # You can write comments to explain your code
  # (they are ignored, but help understanding)
  
  # Check if number is even (divisible by two)
  # 0=Yes 1=No
  number_of_people_in_this_room %% 2
```

```
[1] 1
```


What is R? (3)
========================================================
More than one value can go into a single variable as well:

```r
  speaker_names <- c("Katinka", "Simon")
  # They are stored in a numbered list
  # Access single items with square brackets
  speaker_names[2]
```

```
[1] "Simon"
```

```r
  # R calls these lists of items: vector
  speaker_names
```

```
[1] "Katinka" "Simon"  
```


What is R? (4)
========================================================
Ranges of numbers are designed for easy use:

```r
numbers_from_1_to_10 <- 1:10
numbers_from_1_to_10
```

```
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

```r
#remember the example from the first slide?
sum(numbers_from_1_to_10)
```

```
[1] 55
```


What is R? (5)
========================================================
Data frames, the most important data structure:

```r
  # a data frame is a table with labeled rows
  # and columns
  speakers <- data.frame(
    row.names=speaker_names,
    species=c("human", "human"),
    hair_color=c("blonde","brown")
    )
  #print data frame
  speakers
```

```
        species hair_color
Katinka   human     blonde
Simon     human      brown
```


What is R? (6)
========================================================
Data frames, the most important data structure:

```r
  # access a column by name
  speakers$hair_color
```

```
[1] blonde brown 
Levels: blonde brown
```

```r
  # or by index [row,col] where empty means all
  # so give me column 1 of all rows
  speakers[,1]
```

```
[1] human human
Levels: human
```


What is R? (7)
========================================================
How to select rows by name?

```r
  # if row name equals
  simon_row <- row.names(speakers) == "Simon"
  # returns a vector of True and False values
  simon_row
```

```
[1] FALSE  TRUE
```

```r
  # This can be used as index list as well
  # with row index simon_row return all columns
  speakers[simon_row,]
```

```
      species hair_color
Simon   human      brown
```


From Excel to R? (1)
========================================================
Excel tables and data frames are similar, however:
- Data frames must not have different column lengths
- Row and column names are not part of the cells
- Spaces in names are not allowed ($-syntax would not work)
- Column names must be unique
- Non-rectangular tables are problematic
- **One row represents one dataset**

How does this apply to reality?


From Excel to R? (2)
========================================================
![A table of pen sizes and colors in Excel](presentation-figure/excel1.png)

Example Excel sheet with:
- unique headers
- no spaces
- rectangular


From Excel to R? (3)
========================================================
In R this looks like:

```r
  pen_experiment <- read.csv("data/pens.csv")
  pen_experiment
```

```
  ID.length_of_pen.color_of_pen
1                    1;81;black
2                    2;149;blue
3                    3;85;black
4                    4;82;black
5                    5;145;blue
6                    6;85;black
7                    7;85;black
```


From Excel to R? (4)
========================================================
That did not look correct:

```r
  pen_experiment <- read.csv("data/pens.csv",
                             header=TRUE,
                             row.names=1,
                             sep=";")
  pen_experiment
```

```
  length_of_pen color_of_pen
1            81        black
2           149         blue
3            85        black
4            82        black
5           145         blue
6            85        black
7            85        black
```


From Excel to R? (5)
========================================================
Useful next steps:

```r
  summary(pen_experiment)
```

```
 length_of_pen   color_of_pen
 Min.   : 81.0   black:5     
 1st Qu.: 83.5   blue :2     
 Median : 85.0               
 Mean   :101.7               
 3rd Qu.:115.0               
 Max.   :149.0               
```


From Excel to R? (6)
========================================================
Putting comments at the top of your Excel file makes life easier:

***

```r
  read.csv("data/pens2.csv",
        header=TRUE,
        row.names = 1,
        sep=";",
        comment.char = "#")
```

Fitness of Tables? (3)
========================================================
Problems with this layout
![A table of photometric measurements as seen in the wild](presentation-figure/excel3.png)
---
- These are four tables not one
- Tables are placed almost randomly 
- row and column identities are inconsistent
- One row = One dataset violated


Fitness of Tables? (4)
========================================================
New Layout:
![A table of photometric measurements redesigned for R-compatibility](presentation-figure/excel4.png)
***

- Now we have one table
- Distinction between four tables is implemented through extra category (column)
- One row = One dataset

It is not always about R:
* opportunity to improve Excel skills as well
  - and save time
* compatibility to many tools instead of just one
* closer to the file formats produced by lab hardware
